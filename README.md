==========

A combination of learning knockout.js, markdown, and having fun. Sort of codepen, but for markdown. 

# Roadmap
* have a markdown editor + css - no persistence or link sharing
* starter template for css + modal to show shortcuts for markdown

## Ideas
* editor for writers - pen&paper look&feel
* very lightweight document editor
* have a common denominator for markdown style between browsers/tools
